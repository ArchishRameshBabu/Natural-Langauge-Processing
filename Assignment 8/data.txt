Science and mathematics courses are more beneficial to students than literature and history classes for three reasons. First, the knowledge of science and math is essential to learning other important disciplines. Second, it is more important in everyday life than literature and history. And finally, science and math courses develop logic skills the way the humanities courses cant.

First and foremost importantly, science and mathematics are essential for learning economics, finance, or mechanics, which are disciplines that are invaluable in todays marketplace. Anyone who lacks such knowledge will also have difficulty grasping computers, internet, stocks, insurance, etc. But the knowledge of literature and history barely has any effect on any skills that are vital to todays economic atmosphere.

Science and mathematics are indispensable in daily and professional lives. They show people how to avoid electric shock when doing electrical repairs. They also help people optimize their incomes and expenses effectively. These subjects also play an important role in the workplace. Operating machinery and being responsible for market or finance analysis call for the knowledge of math. But the humanities are hardly helpful in the workplace. Literature and history can only be valuable to the people who teach them, providing them with income. But these teachers represent only a small percentage of population.

Finally, science and mathematics are great logic training. They train students how to analyse numerous variants, and show how to cope with conflicting factors. They cultivate mental perception and stimulate the development of intelligence. History and literature, on the other hand, provide only limited value by providing examples from the past and the writers imagination. The lessons of history are not likely to help solve difficult logical problems that the modern person may encounter almost every day.
